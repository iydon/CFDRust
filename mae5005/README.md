# Course Description
Overview of computational methods for viscous flows including finite difference, finite-volume, and mesoscopic Boltzmann-equation based methods. Treatment of fixed and moving solidfluid and fluid-fluid boundaries. Example code to study physical and numerical issues such as numerical convergence, accuracy, and stability.
